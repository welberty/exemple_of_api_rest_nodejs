# exemple_of_api_rest_nodejs
An example of restfull api implemented in NodeJs.

For the implementation we used "express" as a framework for the web server and the routes of the api, in addition to sequelize for the persistence of the data. The default database is Mysql, but any database supported by sequelize can be used. See: http://docs.sequelizejs.com/.

With the database correctly configured and the packages of npm installed, to run the application in the root directory of the project, just enter the command prompt type:
"cd. \ src \ Presentation \ Api \"
"node. \ app.js"
